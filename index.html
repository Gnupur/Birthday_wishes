<p> <i>Oyy! Happy Birthday da!!
Usually I don't need to think a lot when writing such stuff, but damn what do I exclude now. It just skips beyond comprehension as to how you are able to remain constant in such turbulence. Pretty sure you are the closest friend I have had.  First meeting you way back in September, you still continue to surprise. I wouldn't say we are lucky to have you, isn't it a blessing in the least. Your untimely jokes, random escapes, boundless craziness,I miss that dearly . Someday we'll go to Agartha aight? Your ways though confusing , truly is a transposition of the holy books. Enjoy this day with what you  love 🌴🌊,Stay Blessed and keep reminding us of how fun life actually is. 🐒🐐

<p> <i>Hey today's para is a drop from the sea as there are a lot memories with you and writing few lines is just toil. Still,some of them I tried to list here in my first site which is for you. The speciality of you is the purest heart which a few people have it.I am fortunate for having a friend like you.We shared a lot memories daily in the campus from waking up for class to going for trips and sharing all secrets.
 Our intimacy is eternity in short.There are still many more years ahead awaiting for us and I would be just overjoyed to have you in my future.
Just enjoy your day buddy.Just waiting to take party from you in the campus.We will invite bakari also for the party.

<p> <i>Happy Birthday to the liveliest person I've met 😁
I have never seen a person soo packed to the brim with excitement, adventure and childish innocence at the same time 💫.
Ur kindness and that permanent beautiful smile on ur face is something that can easily make anyone's day 😃. All those silly wierd things u do, ur non stop chatter, the love for animals and all the talks of wisdom is something we all cherish and miss.
And who can forget the resonance we both share.....
May the Divine bless u with all the happiness for u have one of the purest heart I've met 🌸
Can't wait to hear u say

<p> <i>Happy birthday baby girl 😍
 You have been an amazing friend, supported me always. Loved me nothing less than a siso ever. Your kindness is hell inspiring bro for anyone to fall in love with you. I have just too many memories tbh selecting the best is really difficult. Be it that day at Hazo or all those nighouts, Dhansiri dinners with our group, Alcher that morning, or be it bringing me back to the group last time I left. You hold a really special place in my such a short IITG journey yet and I hope this continues. You're awwdorable sweetheart ❤️ whenever I'm sad, you have been there. Thanks a ton. And of course our mutual love for Krishna, how do I forget, may he bless you with the best in everything you wish for! Lucky to have you.
Lots of love and hugs❤️ Meet me soon, I miss you.

<p> <i>Hey roommate!! Remember from not meeting each other for 4 days to being dependent on each other for every single thing,from being friends to being a family the journey with you  has been incredibly beautiful and humourous. Cheers to our countless vows of studying for the next exam to cleaning our room to going to ghat to   early in the morning to not misssing breakfast and reaching lecture halls and labs early and to all the things we never succeeded in. Remember you teaching me Telegu and I teaching you Hindi and then landing in very awkward situations (laila majnu)!You are in blessing in disguise for me. You are one the best people  I have met not only in IITG but in my entire lifes. Wish you a very happy birthday roommate,a sweet, beautiful and a kind hearted girl.
PS:Your name is still saved as roommate in my phone and will continue to do so forever.
❤️

                    The night in front of classroom complex till morning 5am...All are just precious memories..which are just patchy without you.</p>
